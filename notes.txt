The service is built using:
* spring-boot,
* maven,
* java 1.7

The server is configured to use port 8080 by default and so are test scripts.

ASSUMPTIONS

1. For word counts case is insignificant (this seems to be confirmed by examples in spec).
2. The server is given the text to be analyzed before the /search and /top requests are made.

TEST SCRIPTS

Several test scripts are present. These contain file references relative top the project root. To run analyze.sh use:

bash scripts/analyze.sh
